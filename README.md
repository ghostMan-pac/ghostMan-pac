### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Asif
#### Design and Development
I'm Asif. I like to be part of the community and be of help as and where I can. I normally dabble in C as I am working in the system programming side. Just starting out in the open source world.

Skills: C / Linux

- Slowly falling in love with Zephyr
